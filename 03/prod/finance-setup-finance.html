<h1 id="setting-up-finance">Setting Up Finance</h1>

<p>Before you can begin to run your business, you must specify how you want to manage company finance processes. First, you set up the core of the company's accounting records: the chart of accounts (COA). Then you set up posting groups, which make the process of assigning default general ledger posting accounts to customers, vendors, and items more efficient.</p>
<p>Some finance setup can be done automatically with assisted setup guides, and some must be done manually. Learn more at <a href="ui-get-ready-business.html">Getting Ready for Doing Business</a>. The <strong>General Ledger Setup</strong> page specifies how to handle of your company's different accounting processes. For example, use this page to specify invoice rounding details, the currency code for your local currency, address formats, and whether you want to use an additional reporting currency. Learn more at <a href="finance-general-ledger.html">Understanding the General Ledger and the Chart of Accounts</a>.</p>
<p>You can use dimensions to add different types of information to every transaction. You can set up your company's basic dimensions, such as <em>Projects</em> and <em>Departments</em>. Later, add more dimensions when you need them. For example, you can set up temporary dimensions to use for a limited time period, such during a sales campaign. Learn more at <a href="finance-dimensions.html">Working with Dimensions</a>.</p>
<p>Many of the setup tasks must be completed before you can begin recording financial transactions, but most settings can be adjusted as needed. That said, there are optional setup tasks as well. For example, you need only set up intercompany postings and consolidations if you are working with multiple companies. And other setup tasks, such as specifying the period during which posting is allowed, may have to be repeated periodically.</p>
<p>The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.</p>
