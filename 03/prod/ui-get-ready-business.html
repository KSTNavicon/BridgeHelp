To access the page, simply choose <a href="https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=1801">this link</a>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, choose the <img src="media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png" alt="Sprocket icon to open the Settings menu."> icon, and then the <strong>Assisted Setup</strong> action.</p>
<p>You can also find the list of assisted setup guides if you choose the <img src="media/ui-search/search_small.png" alt="Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature." title="Tell me what you want to do"> icon, enter <strong>Assisted Setup</strong>, and then choose the related link.</p>
<div class="TIP">
<h5>Tip</h5>
<p>Business Central includes tooltips for fields and actions that can help guide you through the various business processes. Some pages also have teaching tips and tours to help you. On each tooltip and teaching tip, choose the <strong>Learn more</strong> link to open the Help pane where you find information about the current page and related tasks. On all pages, use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd> on your keyboard to open the Help pane. On any device, use the question mark in the upper right corner to get to the Help.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="get-started">Get started</h2>
<p>When you sign in for the first time or launch a new company, the <strong>Get Started</strong> checklist takes you through the steps to make you ready for business. The steps vary depending on your country/region and any industry-specific functionality that you have added to your Business Central. Starting with 2021 release wave 2, when you first sign in to the CRONUS demonstration company, your home page is optimized for your first experiences. If you prefer to see more links to more pages, just switch to the Business Manager role. For more information, see <a href="ui-change-basic-settings.html">Change Basic Settings</a>.</p>
<p>Once you have migrated data, such as vendors, customers, and items from your existing financial system, you are ready to begin. But depending on your needs, consider if other assisted setup guides on the list can help you.</p>
<p>If an area is not covered by an assisted setup, choose the <img src="media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png" alt="Sprocket icon to open the Settings menu."> icon, and then the <strong>Advanced Settings</strong> action. In <strong>Advanced Settings</strong>, the <strong>Manual Setup</strong> section provides access to setup pages where you can fill in setup fields for all areas manually. For more information, see also <a href="setup.html">Setting Up Business Central</a>.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>The list of assisted setup guides, extensions, and services that are available differ depending on the user experience you choose for your company. The <strong>Essential</strong> experience gives access to fewer than the <strong>Premium</strong> experience does.</p>
<p>The first time you sign in, you use the <strong>Essential</strong> experience. For more information, see <a href="ui-experiences.html">Change Which Features are Displayed</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>When you have run an assisted setup guide, it is marked as <strong>Completed</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="teaching-tips-and-tours">Teaching tips and tours</h2>
<p>Business Central includes in-product tours and teaching tips that can help you get started. In the current version, there are tours for the steps in the <strong>Get started</strong> list and some of the most commonly used pages in the demonstration company, such as the <strong>Sales Invoice</strong> card page.</p>
<p>Teaching tips are short messages that inform, remind, or teach you about important and new capabilities that launch automatically when you open a page. For example, to see the teaching tip for the <strong>Sales Invoice</strong> card, choose the link in the top left corner of the page where it says <em>Sales Invoice</em>. This launches a callout with a short description of the page and what you can do there. If a tour exists for the page, a link invites you to take the tour. The <em>Learn more</em> link takes you to the product Help for the page.</p>
<h2 id="role-specific-home-pages">Role-specific home pages</h2>
<p>Depending on your role, the home page provides an overview of the business. At the top, you see a navigation bar that gives you easy access to customers, vendors, items, and so on. In the center you find the <strong>Activities</strong> tiles. <strong>Activities</strong> show current data and can be clicked or tapped for easy access to the selected document.</p>
<p>The <strong>Key Performance Indicators</strong> can be set up to display a selected chart for a visual representation of, for example, cash flow or income and expenses. You can also build up a list of <strong>Favorite Customers</strong> on the home page for accounts that you do business with often or need to pay special attention to.</p>
<p>Use the arrows to collapse a part of the page and make more room to show specific data. At the top of the home page you will find all of the actions that can be applied to the current content. This too can be collapsed and you only need to click or tap within the collapsed area to view it again.</p>
<div class="TIP">
<h5>Tip</h5>
<p>You can get back to the home page by selecting the company name in the upper left corner.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="company-information">Company information</h2>
<p>Under <strong>Company Settings</strong> you can view and edit setup information about the current company, much of this was prefilled if you completed the <strong>Set Up Company</strong> assisted setup when signing up for Business Central. If you want to change the company logo, contact information, bank settings, or tax information, you can do it from this page.</p>
<h2 id="adding-users-and-permissions">Adding users and permissions</h2>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>Security groups are new to Business Central in 2023 release wave 1. They're similar to the user groups that this article mentions. Like user groups, administrators assign the permissions to the security group that its members need to do their jobs.</p>
<p>User groups will no longer be available in a future release. You can continue using user groups to manage permissions until then. To learn more about security groups, go to <a href="ui-security-groups.html">Control Access to Business Central Using Security Groups</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>You add users in Microsoft 365 admin center. For more information, see <a href="ui-how-users-permissions.html">Create Users According to Licenses</a>.</p>
<p>When users are created in Microsoft 365, you can import them to the <strong>Users</strong> page by using the <strong>Get Updates from Office 365</strong> action. You can then assign permissions to users and to organize them in user groups. For more information, see <a href="ui-define-granular-permissions.html">Assign Permissions to Users and Groups</a>.</p>
<h2 id="product-help">Product Help</h2>
<p>Business Central includes tooltips for fields and actions that can help guide you through the various business processes. Some pages also have teaching tips and tours to help you.
